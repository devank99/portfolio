    description: "Empowering decisions: A dashboard analyzing sales, customer behavior, and inventory to drive growth and improve the shopping experience.",
    longDescription: "This project developed a data analysis dashboard for a clothing store to provide insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management. By analyzing key metrics such as total sales of â‚¹2,11,76,377 from 31,047 orders, the dashboard revealed that March had the highest number of orders (2,843), with Amazon contributing 34.5% of total orders. The analysis highlighted that women, especially adult women, were the primary buyers, and the top five sales-generating states were Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. Based on these insights, strategies were recommended, such as running promotions in peak months (February and March), enhancing Amazon and Myntra presence, and tailoring marketing efforts towards female shoppers while also targeting underperforming platforms and demographics.",

The process began with data cleaning in Microsoft Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency, followed by exploratory data analysis to identify spending patterns based on factors such as expense type and gender. Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize the findings, enabling dynamic filtering and providing valuable insights into user behavior, which can support data-driven decision-making for financial institutions.",

    longDescription: "For this project, I built a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service. After extensive feature engineering and model selection (testing logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting), the final model achieved 87% accuracy in identifying at-risk customers. The implementation of proactive retention strategies based on these predictions resulted in a 23% reduction in churn rate over 6 months, saving an estimated $450,000 in annual recurring revenue.",
